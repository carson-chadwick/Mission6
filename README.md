Due 2/14/25
Our (pretend) client this week is Joel Hilton (my brother, who is 2 years, 2 months, 
and 2 days younger than myself), and who is also very into film. So into film, in 
fact, that he minored in Film Studies at BYU, contracts as a movie reviewer for 
ClearPlay, and does a weekly podcast about films & pop culture called Baconsale.
Joel needs a system to keep track of his ever-expanding movie collection. He only 
allows movies he deems worthy into his collection. As his collection began to 
grow, he created a spreadsheet to keep track of all his info.
